# SIMPLE-FOOD-CLASSIFICATION
🍎 Simple Fruit Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building a basic fruit classification model using machine learning. The goal is to classify images of fruits such as apples, bananas, and oranges using a supervised learning approach.

📁 Files
simplefruitclass.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with code for loading data, preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model.

🧠 Features
Image loading and preprocessing

Model training using machine learning

Accuracy evaluation and visualization

Basic classification of fruits

🔧 Requirements
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
Or, if you're using Jupyter:


!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-fruit-classification.git
cd simple-fruit-classification
Launch the notebook:


jupyter notebook simplefruitclass.ipynb
Follow the cells to preprocess data, train your model, and evaluate performance.

📊 Output
Accuracy metrics for fruit classification

Plots showing data distribution or model evaluation (e.g., confusion matrix)

📌 Notes
This project is a simple demonstration and is not optimized for production.

You can expand the dataset or model complexity to improve performance.
